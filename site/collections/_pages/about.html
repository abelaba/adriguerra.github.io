        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        From the serene Swiss mountains to the colorful traditions of Guatemala, my upbringing wove together a diverse blend of cultures, values and ambitions, shaping both my personal and professional journey.
        <br>
        <br>
        Raised by a dad who could speak binary if you asked nicely, and a mom who fought battles in every room like it was her daily workout, 
        my path was written in the stars before I even stepped onto the scene.
        <br>
        <br>
        My academic interests led me to study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I mastered the fine art of thriving on a potent mix of caffeine and adrenaline-fueled deadlines, all while securing a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems and a Master's in Data Science.

        <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        Rather than embracing the allure of distant shores, my summer breaks as a student were dedicated to mastering the ebb and flow of volatile energy prices.
        Three consecutive summer internships at Koch Industries, allowed me to dive headfirst into the wild world of quantitative analysis and data science tools applied to energy commodity trading.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although my experience in commodity trading was extremely positive, I found myself craving new challenges. 
        I was drawn to the idea of doing something unique and pioneering: starting a cannabis startup. 
        To bring this vision to life, I delved into Switzerland's entrepreneurial ecosystem, expanding my network and familiarizing myself with the country's innovation landscape.
        I learned firsthand that starting a business here involves more twists and turns than a mountain pass, but the highs (no pun intended) definitely made the journey worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eager to maintain my entrepreneurial momentum, I became part of Capgemini's latest initiative: the data squad. 
        I envisioned myself embarking on an adventure akin to a digital James Bond mission.
        However, I soon realized that our "super cool" project was essentially becoming the janitors of the digital world, tasked with tidying up the chaotic data messes of mega-corporations in legacy software systems I barely remembered existed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Craving a break from my role as the go-to tech minion for the corporate overlords, I yearned for a taste of the business and strategy world. 
        That's when I stumbled into OWT, a place where Switzerland's finest entrepreneurs sharpened their pencils (and minds). 
        At OWT, I felt like I was living a dream, crafting exquisite products from mere thoughts to tangible triumphs.
        I threw myself into the work with the passion of a love-struck teenager, pouring my heart, soul, and probably a few too many late nights into the mix.
        But, like all whirlwind romances, I eventually hit the burnout wall. 
        Torn to bits as if I had broken up with my highschool sweetheart, I left everything behind to travel around the world.

        <h2>Why Freelancing</h2>
        <p align="justify">
          After a break from the complex landscapes of large corporations and institutions, I transitioned into freelancing with enthusiasm. 
          Embarking on this journey became necessary to embrace the freedom that aligns with achieving a harmonious balance across various facets of my life. 
          I found in freelancing not just unmatched flexibility but a profound opportunity to tackle diverse projects around the globe, each presenting its distinct objectives, resonating deeply with my personal identity and life's mission.
          <br>
          <br>
          The essence of my data freelancing journey is a testament to the power of blending professional flexibility with personal development and cultural exchange. 
          Embracing diverse global projects enriches both my professional expertise and personal growth, creating a dynamic interplay between the work I do and the life I lead.
          <br>
          <br>
          But my professional aspirations are just one facet of my freelancing journey. 
          Equally important is the freedom acquired to nurture other areas of my life, such as practicing yoga and exploring music. 
          These are not mere hobbies but essential components of my well-being and personal growth, enabling me to evolve in a more rounded and holistic manner.
          <br>
          <br>
          Moreover, my journey is deeply rooted in a commitment to fostering a sustainable future for our society and planet. 
          My endeavors, both personal and professional, are driven by a vision of achieving harmony between humanity and natureâ€”a vision where this balance is not merely an aspiration but a tangible reality.

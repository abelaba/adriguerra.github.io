      <p>Welcome to my digital space!
        <br>
        <br>
        I am Adrian Guerra, a fusion of Swiss precision and Guatemalan vibrancy, embodied as a Data Scientist and IT Project Manager.
        <br>
        <br>
        Born amidst the serene landscapes of Switzerland and enriched by the lively hues of Guatemalan culture, 
        I have been fortunate to inherit a legacy of two worlds. 
        This unique blend of cultures has shaped my perspective, fueling my aspirations and grounding my values.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a proud alumnus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I pursued a Master's degree in Data Science following a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems. 
        My academic journey not only equipped me with advanced skills in data analysis and information technologies, but also nurtured a mindset geared towards critical thinking and innovation.
        <br>
        <br>
        My professional journey began with internships in commodity trading at Koch Industries, honing my skills as a quantitative analyst and data scientist. 
        Nonetheless, the entrepreneurial spirit within me led to an exciting venture into launching a cannabis startup, an endeavor that taught me invaluable lessons through participation in competitions and startup programmes across Switzerland.
        <br>
        <br>
        After concluding my startup venture, I embraced the opportunity to join Capgemini’s Insights & Data team, further enriching my experience and expertise. My quest for diverse experiences took me to Swisscom, Switzerland’s premier mobile operator, where I contributed as a Business Analyst, broadening my understanding of digital transformation and business analysis.
        <br>
        <br>
        In everything I have done, I have always sought purpose through service. 
        Supporting clients and teams with dedication, accessibility, and a readiness to assist.
        <br>
        <br>
        This ethos extends to my personal passions as well. 
        Yoga is not just a practice for me; it's a way of life. 
        Teaching and sharing the principles of yoga allows me to contribute to the well-being of others, reflecting my deep commitment to fostering a more sustainable future for society and our planet. 
        This commitment is a guiding principle in both my personal and professional decisions, reflecting my dream of a world where harmony between humans and the universe isn't just an ideal, but a reality.
        <br>
        <br>
        Join me on this journey of discovery, innovation, and service. Together, let's envision and work towards a more sustainable world filled with harmony and well-being.

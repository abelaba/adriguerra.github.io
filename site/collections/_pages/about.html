        Hey, hey, hey! Welcome to my digital space.
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Adrian Guerra. Like a chocolate-vanilla swirl – I'm sometimes sweet, sometimes bold, but always surprising!
        <br>
        <br>
        From the serene Swiss mountains to the colorful traditions of Guatemala, my upbringing wove together a diverse blend of cultures, values and ambitions, shaping both my personal and professional journey.
        <br>
        <br>
        Raised by a dad who could speak binary if you asked nicely and a mom who fought battles in every room like it was her daily workout, 
        my path was written in the stars before I even stepped onto the scene.
        <br>
        <br>
        My academic interests led me to study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I mastered the fine art of thriving on a potent mix of caffeine and adrenaline-fueled deadline dashes, all while securing a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems and a Master's in Data Science.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rather than embracing the allure of distant shores, my summers were dedicated to mastering the ebb and flow of volatile energy prices.
        At Koch Industries, I would dive headfirst into the wild world of quantitative analysis and data science tools, applied to energy commodity trading.
        <br>
        <br>
        Three consecutive summers made me realize that the buttoned-up, sophisticated world of traders didn't exactly suit me.
        Venturing down the entrepreneurial path less traveled seemed more appealing, so I tried my luck launching a cannabis startup. 
        I immersed myself in Switzerland's entrepreneurial scene, learning firsthand that starting a business here involves more twists and turns than a mountain pass, but the highs (pun intended) definitely made the journey worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I signed up with Capgemini's freshest crew, the data squad, thinking I was about to dive into the digital equivalent of a Bond mission. 
        Imagine my surprise when I discovered that our "super cool" project was essentially becoming the janitors of the digital world, tasked with tidying up the chaotic messes of mega-corporations. 
        There I was, a supposed data science maestro, knee-deep in legacy software that I had forgotten had once existed (Microsoft Access).
        <br>
        <br>
        Craving a break from my role as the go-to tech minion for the corporate overlords, I yearned for a taste of the business and strategy world. 
        I didn't want to be the digital handyman anymore, itching instead to step into the shoes of a strategy-savvy gent. 
        That's when I stumbled into OWT, a place where Switzerland's finest entrepreneurs sharpened their pencils (and minds). 
        At OWT, I was living a dream, crafting exquisite products from mere thoughts to tangible triumphs.
        I threw myself into the work with the passion of a love-struck teenager, pouring my heart, soul, and probably a few too many late nights and weekends into the mix.
        But, like all whirlwind romances, I eventually hit the burnout wall. 
        Torn to pieces as if I had just broken up with my highschool sweetheart, I took off with the zeal of a free bird to travel around the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        After a break from the complex landscapes of large corporations and institutions, I transitioned into the data freelancing lifestyle with enthusiasm. 
        This choice affords me unparalleled flexibility, allowing me to offer my expertise globally. 
        My professional journey now spans a wide array of clients, from European SMEs in pursuit of innovative strategies to revitalize their operations, to Latin American companies seeking insightful guidance to navigate their strategic challenges. 
        My office is the world itself, transforming any space where my laptop can open into a hub of creativity and productivity – the true embodiment of a digital nomad lifestyle.
        <br>
        <br>
        My approach to work is driven by more than the completion of tasks; it's fueled by a genuine aspiration to instigate significant, enduring transformation. 
        At the heart of my professional ethos is the pursuit of impact. 
        This principle steers me as I tackle the complexities of the digital era, striving to infuse every project with a blend of excellence, innovation, and zeal. 
        My ultimate goal is to not just meet, but exceed, the expectations of my clients, embedding a sense of purpose and commitment into the fabric of digital transformation. 
        Through a harmonious mix of skill and flexibility, I am dedicated to making a tangible difference in the success of those I work with, no matter where they may be located.

        This philosophy is deeply intertwined with my personal values, where yoga has played a pivotal role in shaping my outlook and growth. 
        Yoga transcends physical exercise; it is a holistic practice that harmonizes mind, body, and spirit, teaching me that true boundaries are non-existent. 
        By immersing myself in the study, teaching, and sharing of yoga's core principles, I have been able to extend its benefits beyond myself, positively influencing the well-being of others. 
        This reflects my profound commitment to fostering a sustainable future for our society and the planet. 
        My endeavors, both personal and professional, are underpinned by a vision of a world where harmony between humanity and the natural world is not just an aspiration but a lived reality.

        Hey, hey, hey! Welcome to my digital space.
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Adrian Guerra. Like a chocolate-vanilla swirl – I'm sometimes sweet, sometimes bold, but always surprising!
        <br>
        <br>
        From the serene Swiss mountains to the colorful traditions of Guatemala, my upbringing wove together a diverse blend of cultures, values and ambitions, shaping both my personal and professional journey.
        <br>
        <br>
        Raised by a dad who could speak binary if you asked nicely and a mom who fought battles in every room like it was her daily workout, 
        my path was written in the stars before I even stepped onto the scene.
        <br>
        <br>
        My academic interests led me to study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I mastered the fine art of thriving on a potent mix of caffeine and adrenaline-fueled deadline dashes, all while securing a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems and a Master's in Data Science.
        <br>
        <br>
        Instead of embracing the allure of distant shores, my summers were dedicated to mastering the ebb and flow of volatile energy prices.
        At Koch Industries, I dived headfirst into the wild world of quantitative analysis and data science tools, aiming to comprehend energy commodity trading.
        <br>
        <br>
        Three consecutive summers made me realize that the buttoned-up, sophisticated world of traders didn't exactly suit me.
        Venturing down the entrepreneurial path less traveled seemed more appealing and I tried my luck launching a cannabis startup. 
        I immersed myself in Switzerland's entrepreneurial scene and learned firsthand that starting a business here involves more twists and turns than a mountain pass, but the highs (pun intended) definitely made the journey worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I signed up with Capgemini's freshest crew, the data squad, thinking I was about to dive into the digital equivalent of a Bond mission. 
        Imagine my surprise when I discovered that our "super cool" project was essentially becoming the janitors of the digital world, tasked with tidying up the chaotic messes of mega-corporations. 
        There I was, a supposed data science maestro, knee-deep in legacy software that I had even forgotten had once existed (erm, Microsoft Access).
        <br>
        <br>
        Craving a break from my role as the go-to tech minion for the corporate overlords, I yearned for a taste of the business and strategy world. 
        I was done being the digital handyman, itching instead to step into the shoes of a strategy-savvy gent. 
        That's when I stumbled into OWT, a place where Switzerland's finest entrepreneurs sharpened their pencils (and minds). 
        Here, innovation wasn't just a buzzword—it was the breakfast of champions.
        At OWT, I wasn't just learning; I was living the dream, crafting exquisite products from mere thoughts to tangible triumphs.
        I threw myself into the work with the passion of a love-struck teenager, pouring my heart, soul, and probably a few too many weekends into the mix.
        But, like all whirlwind romances, I hit the burnout wall. 
        I was torn to pieces, as if I had just broken up with my highschool sweetheart.
        Nonetheless, I got the adventure I craved, learned a ton, and then, with the zeal of a free bird, I took off to travel to look for the meaning of life. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After a break from the complex landscapes of large corporations and institutions, I transitioned into the data freelancing lifestyle with enthusiasm. 
        This choice affords me unparalleled flexibility, allowing me to offer my expertise globally. 
        The ability to work with a diverse range of clients, from European SMEs seeking innovative solutions to energize their operations, to Latin American companies in need of strategic guidance.
        My workspace is wherever I can open my laptop, embodying the essence of a digital nomad.
        <br>
        <br>
        My commitment goes beyond mere assignments; I am driven by a desire to effect meaningful, long-term change. 
        Impact is the cornerstone of my professional philosophy, guiding me as I navigate through the challenges of the digital age. 
        My objective is to inject a sense of excellence, innovation and enthusiasm into every project I undertake, prioritizing purpose and dedication in my quest to enhance the field of data project management. 
        Through a careful balance of expertise and adaptability, I aim to contribute significantly to my clients' success, wherever that may be.
        <br>
        <br>
        This philosophy permeates my personal interests too. 
        Yoga, for me, transcends cultures and borders.
        More than just exercise; it embodies a comprehensive lifestyle. 
        By studying, teaching and disseminating yoga's foundational principles, I am able to positively impact the well-being of others, mirroring my profound dedication to promoting a sustainable future for both society and our environment. 
        This dedication underpins my choices in both my personal life and professional endeavors, illustrating my vision of a world where harmony between humans and nature is not merely an ideal, but a reality.

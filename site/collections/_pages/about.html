        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        From the serene Swiss mountains to the colorful traditions of Guatemala, my upbringing wove together a diverse blend of cultures, values and ambitions, shaping both my personal and professional journey.
        <br>
        <br>
        Raised by a dad who could speak binary if you asked nicely and a mom who fought battles in every room like it was her daily workout, 
        my path was written in the stars before I even stepped onto the scene.
        <br>
        <br>
        My academic interests led me to study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I mastered the fine art of thriving on a potent mix of caffeine and adrenaline-fueled deadlines, all while securing a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems and a Master's in Data Science.

        <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        Rather than embracing the allure of distant shores, my summers were dedicated to mastering the ebb and flow of volatile energy prices.
        At Koch Industries, I dived headfirst into the wild world of quantitative analysis and data science tools, applied to energy commodity trading.
        <br>
        <br>
        Three consecutive summers made me realize that the buttoned-up, sophisticated world of traders didn't exactly suit me.
        Venturing down the entrepreneurial path less traveled seemed more appealing, so I tried my luck launching a cannabis startup. 
        I immersed myself in Switzerland's entrepreneurial scene, learning firsthand that starting a business here involves more twists and turns than a mountain pass, but the highs (pun intended) definitely made the journey worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Seeking a new adventure, I joined Capgemini's freshest crew, the data squad, thinking I was about to dive into the digital equivalent of a Bond mission. 
        There, I discovered that our "super cool" project was essentially becoming the janitors of the digital world, tasked with tidying up the chaotic messes of mega-corporations. 
        There I was, a supposed data science maestro, knee-deep in legacy software that I had forgotten had once existed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Craving a break from my role as the go-to tech minion for the corporate overlords, I yearned for a taste of the business and strategy world. 
        I didn't want to be the digital handyman anymore, itching instead to step into the shoes of a strategy-savvy gent. 
        That's when I stumbled into OWT, a place where Switzerland's finest entrepreneurs sharpened their pencils (and minds). 
        At OWT, I was living a dream, crafting exquisite products from mere thoughts to tangible triumphs.
        I threw myself into the work with the passion of a love-struck teenager, pouring my heart, soul, and probably a few too many late nights and weekends into the mix.
        But, like all whirlwind romances, I eventually hit the burnout wall. 
        Torn to bits like as if I had broken up with my highschool sweetheart, I took off with the zeal of a free bird to travel around the world.
        <br>

        <h2>Why Freelancing</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        After a break from the complex landscapes of large corporations and institutions, I transitioned into the data freelancing world with enthusiasm. 
        Embarking on the data freelancing journey was necessary to embrace the ultimate freedom that aligns with achieving a harmonious balance across various facets of my life. 
        I found in freelancing not just unmatched flexibility but a profound opportunity to tackle diverse projects around the globe. 
        Each project presents its distinct objectives, resonating deeply with my personal identity and life's mission.
        <br>
        <br>
        This venture into freelancing has opened up the world to me, allowing me to share my expertise to anyone who desires it.
        Finally, I have been able to collaborate both with European enterprises on the hunt for groundbreaking data solutions and partnered with Latin American firms seeking strategic insights to steer through their distinct challenges.
        This global office space, where my laptop lies open, has become a crucible of creativity and productivity—embodying the essence of a digital nomad's lifestyle.
        <br>
        <br>
        But my professional aspirations are just one facet of my freelancing journey.
        Equally important is the freedom acquired to nurture other areas of my life, such as practicing yoga and exploring music. 
        These are not mere hobbies but essential components of my well-being and personal growth, enabling me to evolve in a more rounded and holistic manner.
        <br>
        <br>
        The essence of my data freelancing journey is a testament to the power of blending professional flexibility with personal development and cultural exchange.
        It highlights the significance of not just acquiring knowledge from across the globe but also sharing it, nourishing my passions for yoga and music along the way—pillars of my overall well-being and happiness.
        This lifestyle epitomizes the ethos of a digital nomad, providing a vast canvas to craft a life filled with professional adaptability, personal growth, and intercultural sharing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moreover, my journey is deeply rooted in a commitment to fostering a sustainable future for our society and planet. 
        My endeavors, both personal and professional, are driven by a vision of achieving harmony between humanity and nature—a vision where this balance is not merely an aspiration but a tangible reality.

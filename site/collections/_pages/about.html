      <p>Welcome to my digital space!
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm Adrian Guerra, a unique blend of Swiss precision and Guatemalan vibrancy, serving as a Data Project Manager with a passion for driving innovation and fostering meaningful connections. Born in the serene landscapes of Switzerland and raised amidst the lively culture of Guatemala, my upbringing has instilled in me a fusion of values and aspirations that define my personal and professional life.

        My academic foundation was laid at the esteemed Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems, followed by a Master's in Data Science. This journey not only introduced me to the realms of data analysis and information technologies but, most importantly, fostered a mindset of critical thinking and innovation.

        Early in my career, I gained invaluable experience working with seasoned software developers at Koch Industries, where I contributed as an intern in quantitative analysis and data science tools applied to energy commodity trading.

        My entrepreneurial spirit soon led me to launch a cannabis startup, immersing myself in Switzerland's entrepreneurial community and learning firsthand the challenges and rewards of starting a business.

        After this venture, I joined Capgemini's Insights & Data team, further expanding my horizons and deepening my understanding of digital transformation. My quest for diverse experiences brought me to OWT, a leading consulting firm acquired by Swisscom, where I learned from talented consultants and contributed to the Marketing team, enhancing our client case publication process.

        Throughout my career, my mission has been to serve with purpose, dedication, and a readiness to support clients and teams alike. My background, blending diverse cultures and interdisciplinary knowledge, fuels my commitment to excellence and innovation in the ever-evolving field of data project management.

        This ethos extends to my personal passions as well. Yoga is not just a practice for me; it's a way of life. Teaching and sharing the principles of yoga allows me to contribute to the well-being of others, reflecting my deep commitment to fostering a more sustainable future for society and our planet. This commitment is a guiding principle in both my personal and professional decisions, reflecting my dream of a world where harmony between humans and the universe isn't just an ideal, but a reality.

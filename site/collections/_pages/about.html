        Hey, hey, hey! Welcome to my digital space.
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Adrian Guerra. Like a jazz melody – I'm sometimes sweet, sometimes bold, but always surprising!
        <br>
        <br>
        From the serene Swiss mountains to the colorful traditions of Guatemala, my upbringing wove together a diverse blend of cultures, values and ambitions, shaping both my personal and professional journey.
        <br>
        <br>
        Raised by a dad who could speak binary if you asked nicely and a mom who fought battles in every room like it was her daily workout, 
        my path was written in the stars before I even stepped onto the scene.
        <br>
        <br>
        My academic interests led me to study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), where I mastered the fine art of thriving on a potent mix of caffeine and adrenaline-fueled deadline dashes, all while securing a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems and a Master's in Data Science.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rather than embracing the allure of distant shores, my summers were dedicated to mastering the ebb and flow of volatile energy prices.
        At Koch Industries, I dived headfirst into the wild world of quantitative analysis and data science tools, applied to energy commodity trading.
        <br>
        <br>
        Three consecutive summers made me realize that the buttoned-up, sophisticated world of traders didn't exactly suit me.
        Venturing down the entrepreneurial path less traveled seemed more appealing, so I tried my luck launching a cannabis startup. 
        I immersed myself in Switzerland's entrepreneurial scene, learning firsthand that starting a business here involves more twists and turns than a mountain pass, but the highs (pun intended) definitely made the journey worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Seeking a new adventure, I joined Capgemini's freshest crew, the data squad, thinking I was about to dive into the digital equivalent of a Bond mission. 
        Imagine my surprise when I discovered that our "super cool" project was essentially becoming the janitors of the digital world, tasked with tidying up the chaotic messes of mega-corporations. 
        There I was, a supposed data science maestro, knee-deep in legacy software that I had long forgotten once existed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Craving a break from my role as the go-to tech minion for the corporate overlords, I yearned for a taste of the business and strategy world. 
        I didn't want to be the digital handyman anymore, itching instead to step into the shoes of a strategy-savvy gent. 
        That's when I stumbled into OWT, a place where Switzerland's finest entrepreneurs sharpened their pencils (and minds). 
        At OWT, I was living a dream, crafting exquisite products from mere thoughts to tangible triumphs.
        I threw myself into the work with the passion of a love-struck teenager, pouring my heart, soul, and probably a few too many late nights and weekends into the mix.
        But, like all whirlwind romances, I eventually hit the burnout wall. 
        Torn to pieces as if I had just broken up with my highschool sweetheart, I took off with the zeal of a free bird to travel around the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        After a break from the complex landscapes of large corporations and institutions, I transitioned into the data freelancing world with enthusiasm. 
        This shift has not only given me unmatched flexibility but also the opportunity to share my expertise globally. 
        My professional endeavors span a wide mix of clients, ranging from European enterprises seeking innovative solutions, to Latin American firms in need of strategic insights to overcome their challenges. 
        My office is the world itself, transforming any space where my laptop can open into a hub of creativity and productivity – epitomizing the essence of the digital nomad lifestyle.
        <br>
        <br>
        My work ethic transcends the simple completion of tasks; it is propelled by a deep-seated desire to effect substantial and lasting change. 
        At the core of my professional philosophy lies a commitment to creating impact. 
        This guiding principle directs my efforts as I navigate the complexities of today's digital landscape, aiming to infuse each project with a measure of excellence, innovation, and passion. 
        My objective is not merely to fulfill, but to surpass the expectations of my clients, instilling a deeper sense of purpose and dedication in the realm of digital transformation. 
        With a perfect blend of expertise and adaptability, I am fervently committed to enhancing the success of those I collaborate with, irrespective of their geographical location.
        <br>
        <br>
        This philosophy is deeply intertwined with my personal values, where yoga has played a pivotal role in shaping my outlook and growth. 
        Yoga, for me, goes beyond mere physical exercise; it is a holistic practice that harmonizes mind, body, and spirit. 
        By immersing myself in the study, teaching, and sharing of yoga's core principles, I have been able to extend its benefits beyond myself, positively influencing the well-being of others. 
        This reflects my profound commitment to fostering a sustainable future for our society and the planet. 
        My endeavors, both personal and professional, are underpinned by a vision of a world where harmony between humans and nature is not just an aspiration but a reality.

**Project Description:**

This project embarked on a transformative journey in the semiconductor industry, with the primary goal of optimizing cost allocation processes for STMicroelectronics, a key player in the sector. The focus was on the intricate financial data related to the production and material costs of wafers, a fundamental component in semiconductor manufacturing.

Over several weeks, an exhaustive analysis was carried out on the financial controller data specific to wafer production and material costs. This endeavor was not just about data analysis but also about integrating advanced machine learning techniques to classify these costs into multiple categories accurately. The project was framed as a multi-class classification task, requiring a nuanced understanding of both the financial and technical aspects of the semiconductor industry.

The backbone of this project was a comprehensive machine learning report that not only detailed the distribution of the data but also offered a deep dive into various predictive models explored, including:

1. **Regression Analysis:** Employed to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables, aiding in understanding the impact of various factors on cost allocation.

2. **Decision Trees:** Used for their simplicity and interpretability, these models provided clear insights into the decision-making process based on historical data.

3. **Naive Bayes:** This probabilistic approach classified costs by applying the Bayes theorem, assuming independence among predictors, a technique particularly suited for high-dimensional data.

4. **Neural Networks:** Leveraged for their ability to model complex and non-linear relationships, these networks brought sophistication to the predictive models.

5. **Ensemble Methods:** These methods combined multiple models to improve predictive performance and robustness, ensuring a more accurate cost allocation.

A significant highlight of this project was the integration of the final algorithm with the SAP Data Intelligence platform. Given that SAP was the incumbent procurement platform used by STMicroelectronics, this integration was pivotal for seamless implementation and real-time application.

## Outcome

The project's culmination was not just theoretical but had tangible benefits. An impressive 90% of costs were automatically allocated with high certainty, streamlining the process and freeing up valuable resources. The remaining 10%, which required a nuanced understanding and manual intervention, were allocated by financial controllers. This strategic blend of automation and human oversight resulted in significant cost savings and enhanced efficiency for STMicroelectronics, setting a benchmark for financial processes in the semiconductor industry.
